;; PART ONE
;;
;; As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.
;;
;; This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with .:
;;
;; ..X...
;; .SAMX.
;; .A..A.
;; XMAS.S
;; .X....
;;
;; The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:
;;
;; MMMSXXMASM
;; MSAMXMSMSA
;; AMXSXMAAMM
;; MSAMASMSMX
;; XMASAMXAMM
;; XXAMMXXAMA
;; SMSMSASXSS
;; SAXAMASAAA
;; MAMMMXMMMM
;; MXMXAXMASX
;;
;; In this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with .:
;;
;; ....XXMAS.
;; .SAMXMS...
;; ...S..A...
;; ..A.A.MS.X
;; XMASAMX.MM
;; X.....XA.A
;; S.S.S.S.SS
;; .A.A.A.A.A
;; ..M.M.M.MM
;; .X.X.XMASX
;;
;; Take a look at the little Elf's word search. How many times does XMAS appear?

  ;; so we want to generate the following transformations of this character matrix:
  ;;   1. as-is (no transformation)
  ;;   2. mirrored (y-axis)
  ;;   3. rotated 90deg
  ;;   4. rotated 90deg + mirrored
  ;;   5. N-diagonal
  ;;   6. N-diagonal + mirrored
  ;;   7. anti-N diagonal
  ;;   8. anti-N diagonal + mirrored
  ;; then for each one we just count the number of matches of "XMAS"
  ;; we don't have to worry about overlapping matches in the case of this particular search
  ;; string, bc all the characters in the search string are distinct from all others.
  ;;
  ;; Or actually i guess it would be more efficient to generate only 4 transformations
  ;; and search for both "XMAS" and "SAMX" in each one, which eliminates the mirrors.
  ;;
  ;; i could write transformation functions myself, but i've decided to bust out
  ;; core.matrix for this ðŸ˜Ž

  ;; this is correct since we're only looking at the first row of the untransformed test input

  ;; now i'm going to pull in core.matrix to generate the transformations for real
  ;; first of all, i need to create a matrix of chars. it cannot be a full string for each
  ;; row bc then the transpositions won't be computed correctly.
  ;; maybe i can just do this?
  (vec "test")
  ;; oh yeah! it's that easy.
  ;; so therefore our matrix is:
  (def test-matrix (matrix/array (map vec test-input)))

  ;; and then the two functions i'm interested in are (transpose) and (diagonal)
  (matrix/transpose test-matrix)
  (matrix/diagonal test-matrix)
  (matrix/diagonal test-matrix -1)
  (matrix/diagonal test-matrix 9)
  (matrix/diagonal test-matrix -8)

  (matrix/rotate test-matrix 1 1)
  (matrix/transpose (matrix/rotate test-matrix 0 5))
  ;; so it's easy to get the first three transformations, but the final transformation,
  ;; what is apparently called the minor diagonals, doesn't have a corresponding function
  ;; in core.matrix AFAICT. So from my research i will have to manually reverse the order

  ;; and then the last thing before we can put it all together is a function to
  ;; turn the matrix back into a vector of strings that we can search on:
  (first test-matrix) ;; => [\M \M \M \S \X \X \M \A \S \M]
